\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:chap4}

\section*{}

This chapter sums up the objectives and restates the context of the project, along with its planned activities, and gives, as a final recap, its future work.

\section{Objectives}

As previous stated, the main objective of this dissertation is to develop a library capable of predicting future access logs based on past access logs,
where the generated access logs must have the same attributes as the original ones. This objective can be divided into two main problems, namely the
prediction of the individuals of the original dataset that will reappear in the future and the prediction of new instances which had never appeared
in the past entries of the dataset. 

\section{Project}

The project be the final product resulting of the fulfilment of what was previously stated. When the project is done, it will be possible to use the 
generated data to calculate the value of an inventory on future campaigns.

\section{Future Work}

The results will be evaluated and validated. Depending on the results, some features can be better explored to try
to capture certain behaviours that may not be captured by the developed work.
