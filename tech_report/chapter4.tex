\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:chap4}

\section*{}

This chapter sums up the objectives and restates the context of the project, along with its planned activities, and gives, as a final recap, its future work.

\section{Objectives}

As previous stated, the main objective of this dissertation is to develop a library capable of predicting future ad request logs based on past ad request logs,
where the generated access logs must have the same attributes as the original ones. This objective can be divided into two main problems, namely the
prediction of the individuals of the original dataset that will reappear in the future and the prediction of new instances which had never appeared
in the past entries of the dataset. 

\section{Project}

The project will be the final product resulting of the fulfilment of what was previously stated.
The developed library will allow to predict future ad requests based on
historical data. This result will be ready to be used in simulations to
accurately predict the result of online advertisement campaigns and the value of
the publisher's inventory.


\section{Future Work}

The results will be evaluated and validated and, according to them, some features can be better explored to try to capture certain behaviours that may not be captured by the developed work.
