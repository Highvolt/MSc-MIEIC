\section*{}

This chapter sums up the objectives and restates the context of the project, along with its planned activities, and gives, as a final recap, its future work.

\section{Objectives}

As previous stated, the main objective of this dissertation is to develop a library capable of predicting future access logs based on past access logs, where the generated access logs must have the same attributes as the original ones. This objective can be divided into two main problems, namely the prediction of the individuals of the original dataset that will reappear in the future and the prediction of new instances which had never appeared in the past entries of the dataset.
